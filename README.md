# Build a React app
### React is a component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
It allows for multi-page rendering without refreshing the browser.  

1. Navigate to a location on your computer where you want to build the project. Change into that folder
```
mkidr React
cd React
```
2. Run the command that creates a React Project
```
npx create-react-app <APP_NAME>
```
3. Once installed, open the project in your code builder and run 
```
npm start
```
  - The browser should open with a React logo to confirm your app is working
